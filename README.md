# ts-react-boilerplate

My boilerplate for React project use Typescript. Selected Copy & Paste from
Vue and Preact Webpack Boilerplate. Included:

- React
- Typescript
- Jest test with `yarn test`
- fontawesome.io
- css, less, stylus, postcss (spectre.css is included but easy to remove)
- `yarn build` will build the project to `dist`
- `yarn start` for webpack-dev-server
- `yarn lint` to run `tslint`

Source code is put under `frontend` since I planned to put server code under 
`backend`.
